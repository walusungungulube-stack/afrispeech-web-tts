/**
 * Who may start a run, and how often.
 *
 * The service is public and cannot be otherwise: the endpoint and the key are
 * both in the page source, and the key is not a secret in any case. A browser
 * is the only thing that sends an Origin header honestly, so the allowlist
 * stops other people's pages from spending the quota, and stops nothing else.
 * Anyone with curl can reach /speak, and would otherwise be able to spend the
 * Gemini key as fast as they liked.
 *
 * So the aim is not to keep callers out. It is to put a ceiling on what one
 * caller, or many callers, can cost. Three limits, cheapest first:
 *
 *   - per address, per minute, so one caller cannot flood;
 *   - per address, per day, so a caller who waits a minute between requests
 *     still cannot run all day;
 *   - across everyone, per day, which is the one that matters. Per-address
 *     limits are all bypassed by rotating addresses, and a budget is not.
 *
 * Only starts are charged to the allowances. Status polling and fetching
 * finished audio are free and must not be limited, or a legitimate client
 * would be throttled for waiting, and a request that never becomes a run is
 * refused before it is charged, so the day's money cannot be spent on bodies
 * that were never going to be read. What a malformed request does still cost
 * is a socket, so those are counted separately by the flood guard.
